    <h3>About Taiko</h3>
    <p>Taiko is an open source Node.js library for testing modern web applications. 
  Whatever your user can do in a browser -- visit a web page, fill in the form fields, 
  click on the Submit button -- Taiko can automate in a repeatable way.</p>
    <h3>About the book</h3>
    <p>In this book, author Scott Davis (Web Architect and Principal Engineer with ThoughtWorks)
   demonstrates how Taiko empowers you to write User Journey Tests through straightforward 
   examples and a “prove it in code” approach. Each section offers a clear problem to 
   solve with a working code example.  Every use case comes with an explanation to help
   you understand why the solution works and how to customize it to solve your specific problems.
  </p>
    <p>For over 15 years, ThoughtWorkers have been writing and releasing influential open source 
  testing tools like Selenium, WebDriver, RSpec, Cucumber, and Mountebank. If these tools 
  have influenced the way you think about testing, Taiko and User Journey Testing will be 
  welcome additions to your testing toolkit.</p>
